# Background Images 
In order to add an image to an element such as the body, a div, an article etc. is by using the property background-image. 

```css 
div {
    background-image: url("path/to/image.jpg");
    background-size: cover;
}
```

In that piece of code we set the background image to an image saved in a path inside our project, and the property `background-size` is for covering the whole element with the image.
