# Excel Introduction
Excel is a software application used to store and manipulate data. 

## Elements
- **Title bar**: The title bar is the bar displayed at the top of the page. 
- **Worksheet**: Is the primary area where you put data into cells using either the keyboard or other input devices.
- **The command tabs**: These are located below the title bar which allows to use multiple commands.
- **Formula Bar**: The formula bar is the bar where the user can specify a formula or value to a specific cell or column.

## Entering and formatting data 
### Just adding data
Select any cell where you want to place data and start typing until the data is completed. Then press enter. 

### Alignment 
By default excel sets the strings to left align and the numbers to right align. This can be earily changed using the alignment 
options in the alignment section in the command tabs. 

### Suggestions
These are ordered by columns where the next cell can be suggested to be the same as the element with most repetitions in the column. 

### State Names 
When selecting state names or conutries, the software gives the option to convert the elements into Geography. Omce done this, the 
state will display a modal with the state's information, and when printing the worksheet, the symbol that now appears aside the 
state's name will be printed too. 

### Spread data into other cells
To copy the data or formula of one cell to another, just select the corner of the cell and wait until the cursor changes into a narrow
black cross shape. 
Then just drag it into the cells you want to paste the same content. 


### Formatting Data
#### Currency
Select the column that has numbers by highlighting it and then select the currency button on the command tab in the number section

#### Wrap text 
When text overflows the column into another one, just select the Wrap Text option in the alignment section in the command tab. This 
will cause the text to be wrapped in the appropriate cell, making the row larger in Y direction. 

#### Copy the format from a cell to another 
Select the brush in the clipboard section in the command tab in order to copy the format from a cell to the selected cells.
