# Models
The generative AI operates primarily on through two types of models. 
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): Involve two neural networks, the generator and the discriminator, working in tandem to produce highgly realistic outputs. 
- Transformer-based models (GPT and BERT): GPT is Generative Pre-trained Transformer, and BERT is Bidirectional Encoder Representations. Use attention mechanisms to create text that is contextually relevan and stylistically coherent. 


# Artificial Intelligence 
Is the field focused on creating systems capable of performing tasks that would typically require human intelligence. Central to AI is machine learning (ML), where algorithms detect patterns and infer probabilities from data, allowing the machine to improve its performance over time. 

# Machine Learning
Critical domain within artificial intelligence that emphasizes the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to perform specific tasks without explicit instructions. 

## Types of learning
- **Supervised learning**: Algorithms learn from labeled training data, aiming to predict outcomes for new inputs. 
- **Unsupervised learning**: Algorithms identify patterns in data without needing labeled responses, often used for clustering and association. 
- **Reinforcement learning**: Models learn to make sequences of decisions by receiving feedback on the actions' effectiveness. 

## Algorithms and techniques
- Common algorithms include linear regression, decision trees, and neural networks. 
- Advanced techniques involve deep learning, which uses layered neural networks to analyze various levels of data features.

## Data handling and processing
- Effective machine learning requires robust data preprocessing, including normalization, handling missing values, and feature selection to improve model accuracy. 

# Performance evaluation 
- ML models are evaluated based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, ensuring that they perform well on unseen data. 
  
# Application areas
- ML is applied in various fiels as finance for algorithmic trading, healthcare for predictive diagnostics, and autonomous vehicles for navigation systems. 

# Deep Learning 
Deep learning is and advanced branch of ML that uses neural networks with multiple layers, known as deep neural networks. These networks are capable of learning from large amounts of unstructured data.

- Supervised - Where the model is trained with labeled data. 
- Semi-supervised - Which uses a mix of labeled and unlabeled data. 
- Unsupervised - Which relies solely on unlabeled data. 

This technique is particularly effective in areas such as image recognition, natural language processing (NLP), and speech recognition, where conventional machine-learning techniques may fall short due to the data structures' complexity. 

# Neural Networks
Neural networks (NN) are a cornerstone of AI. They are particularly effective in pattern recognition and data interpretation tasks, which they achieve through a structure inspired by the human brain
